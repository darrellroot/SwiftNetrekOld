# SwiftNetrek
This is an attempt by Darrell Root to rewrite the MacTrek Netrek client (by Chris Lukassen) from Objective-C to Swift

As of 24Feb2019 there are 25,535 lines of Objective-C in 120 *.m files in the distribution.
I've converted SoundEffect.m to SoundEffect.swift (1 file) and converted audio from QuickTime
(no longer supported) to AVFoundation.  I also updated some build parameters.

It builds!  It works (barely).  It crashes after a while with selector errors.  If you try to create
a new netrek login it crashes (but guest works).

I hope this port is worthy of Chris Lukassen's excellent work getting Netrek working on the Mac.

For now I'm commenting out source code of retired .m files rather than deleting them.  That way the original source is handy for troubleshooting.  Please only submit pull requests if it builds and mostly works.
